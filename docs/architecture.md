## Modes

### `browser-only`

- Exposes Instant (`chatgpt-web/light`), Medium, High, and Extra High; each model advertises exactly one
  immutable Codex effort matching its ChatGPT browser mode. `chatgpt-web/pro` is appended only when
  the authenticated account exposes Pro.
- Sends the complete Codex context and image attachments to a fresh ChatGPT Temporary Chat. Because this mode has no connector, the context remains an inline composer payload.
- Never starts the broker, tunnel, or MCP server.
- Emits a nonfatal Codex commentary warning that local tools are unavailable for the selected model.

### `full`

- Exposes the same fixed models; Instant through Extra High are tool-capable, while Pro remains
  read-only.
- ChatGPT uses a custom MCP connector backed by `openai/tunnel-client`.
- Every connector call is bound to one outer Codex turn capability.
- Tool calls and results remain in the same ChatGPT response while Codex executes them locally.

## Browser lifecycle

The desktop launcher owns one persistent Electron partition and up to five task-bound browser
tabs. Each Codex task is leased an independent `WebContentsView` and surface ID; Playwright attaches
to that exact surface through a launcher-owned loopback CDP endpoint. It does not launch another
browser or copy authentication state. Each tab opens a fresh Temporary Chat, shares only the local
login partition, and keeps its own document and lifecycle. Completed tabs remain inspectable until
closed. Closing a running tab destroys its page and terminates that browser turn. A sixth concurrent
turn fails explicitly; the cap avoids excessive parallel traffic that could trigger account abuse
controls.

In full mode, tool-capable turns no longer carry the accumulated Codex history through the visible
composer. Before opening the fresh Temporary Chat, the adapter freezes the exact effective Codex
context into an immutable per-turn broker snapshot, assigns it a SHA-256 identity, and gives the
composer only a small `<codex_context_ref>` bootstrap plus the turn capability. After
`codex_bind_turn`, ChatGPT must call `codex_context_manifest` and then `codex_context_next` in strict
cursor order until `eof=true`. The broker rejects native Codex tool execution before the final
context chunk is delivered, and the Responses adapter rejects a browser final answer that skipped
context loading. A repeated delivery of the immediately previous cursor is replay-idempotent so a
transport retry cannot corrupt the cursor. The snapshot dies with its outer Codex turn.

Context chunks contain the same sanitized role-preserving JSON envelope that the old inline route
used; the change is transport, not context authority. Codex still decides the accumulated history,
compaction, tool results, and current user revision. Image bytes remain outside the snapshot and are
attached natively with stable references. Read-only routes that cannot use the custom connector —
including Pro, browser-only mode, and routed compaction — retain the inline JSON fallback.

The appended models advertise the authenticated account's context window and a ten-percent
auto-compaction reserve. Usage is counted with the GPT-5 tokenizer plus fixed platform/image
reserves. For MCP-pulled turns the estimate still includes the complete snapshot even though the
visible bootstrap is small, so Codex compacts against effective model context rather than composer
length. The independent composer-size boundary therefore applies only to inline fallback routes.

Routed compaction v1/v2 runs as a dedicated read-only browser summarization turn with no broker or
local tools, then returns the native replacement-history shape expected by Codex. A prompt-level
checkpoint marker is translated into a visible Codex trace item; tool-capable turns re-bind the
same capability after that checkpoint. Visible ChatGPT status rows become reasoning summaries,
while stable prose between rows becomes native Codex commentary.

## Installation and service lifecycle

Each native desktop package contains Electron, a platform-matched pinned Bun executable, the
Responses bridge, Playwright client code, MCP server, setup, doctor, and the browser helper.
Browser-only mode downloads no browser and requires no system Node/Bun. Full mode separately
downloads the official pinned `openai/tunnel-client` build for the current OS/architecture and
verifies it against the release SHA-256 manifest.

On first launch, the embedded runtime is identity-checked and copied atomically into a private
versioned directory under the application home. Daemon and MCP commands use that durable copy,
which is required because Linux AppImage mount paths are temporary and must never be persisted in
Codex or tunnel configuration.

The launcher is the sole process supervisor on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It starts the optional
tunnel first, waits for healthy/ready evidence, starts the Responses daemon, and then waits for its
versioned health payload. Native login items or an owner-local XDG autostart file launch the app
hidden after sign-in. A marker containing only launcher-owned PIDs lets doctor distinguish the
launcher runtime from a stale or external process. Legacy macOS launchd services are drained and
removed during an explicit launcher migration; launchd remains only for the advanced terminal-only
mode.

Setup keeps Codex's built-in `openai` provider and switches only `openai_base_url`. The daemon
forwards the authenticated official model catalog and appends only the routed models owned by the
`chatgpt-web/` namespace; no static catalog is installed.

The built-in provider attempts a Responses WebSocket prewarm. The local route explicitly returns
HTTP `426`, which is Codex's native capability-negotiation signal for an immediate, session-sticky
switch to its HTTP/SSE transport. No model or provider fallback occurs.

Setup never restarts an already loaded daemon implicitly. A requested stop, restart, replacement,
or uninstall first calls a private authenticated drain endpoint. The daemon rejects new turns and
reports two independent counters:

- active Responses HTTP requests, including native compaction passthrough;
- active ChatGPT browser sessions, including time spent waiting for local Codex tool results.

The lifecycle operation proceeds only when both counters are zero. The launcher then stops the
tunnel through its runtime command and asks the daemon to flush state and exit through an
authenticated shutdown endpoint. If the contract is unavailable, malformed, non-idle, or cannot
be completed, the operation fails closed and restores the drained runtime when possible. An
unexpected child exit is recovered with a bounded restart budget; a crash loop becomes an explicit
launcher error.

## Security invariants

- Bind the Responses proxy and health endpoint to loopback only.
- Store browser state and tunnel credentials under the application home with mode `0600`.
- Protect lifecycle control endpoints with a random application-owned bearer token.
- Never place secret values in command-line arguments, logs, generated profiles, or Git.
- Limit browser turns to five independent task-bound tabs and reject unsupported models explicitly.
  The selected routed model fixes the adapter effort; a conflicting request effort cannot change it.
- Do not retry or switch modes to evade product usage limits.
